Goal:

- Build a (very very) simple linktree/linkbio alternative with nuxt/content and GitJournal mobile app for easy editing

Structure:

- links in "links/"-directory as simple markdown files (not implemented, markdown files are read from root directory currently bc $content('links/') did not work)
- settings.json for title, links, privacy, link (not implemented yet)
- deploy to ghpages or sftp webspace via GitHub Actions (fullstatic, not implemented yet)

Tutorials used:

- Manual installation of nuxt https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/get-started/installation#manual-installation
- https://content.nuxtjs.org/
